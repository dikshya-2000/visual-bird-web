                 <h1>Summary- Assassins Creed: Renaissance</h1>
                <p>The book is based on Ubisofts's best-selling game. It is about a young man named Ezio Auditore whose brothers and father have been hanged by a family 
                   friend named Ulberto Alberti. Ezio joins a guild of Assassins that his father and his uncle Mario are in. The assassin's enemy are the Templars, who 
                   are supported by the ruling families of Italy. During the Book, Ezio hunts down all the Templars on his fathers list. On the way he meets many 
                   different people: some assassins in the guild and some grave enemies.

                <br>    
                   
                   The book is set in Renaissance Italy. The reason the Assassins and the Templars are enemies is because they are both after something in a vault, even 
                   though they have different ideas about what's in it. 

                   <br>

                   In 1477, there was a man named Ezio Auditore, who lived in Florence, Italy. One day, Ezio arrived at his house, to find his brothers and his father, 
                   Giovanni,missing. Ezio's sister explained to him that the guards had taken them away hearing this news, Ezio ran to the prison and saw

                   and he told Ezio to run while he had the chance, Ezio followed his father's words, and was gone.
                <br>
                Then Ezio arrived at his house, he went to his basement and found the secret Entrance. Inside he found a chest, containing a robe, a sword, and a 
                crossbow. He took everything and walked outside.
               
                <br>
                Ezio saw a poster advertising Auditore execution in the center of the city. Panicked, he ran to the city center and saw his father and brothers all about 
                to be hung. Despite his protests, he tried to stop them, but it was too late; they ail died before his eyes.  He was driven by revenge, Ezio had to find

                <p> Assassins Creed Renaissance is a must read book for all the teenagers as it seeks out friendship, revenge and and love towards family. One of best 
                    Sci-Fi stories in English, published first in 2009, Oliver Bowden's  Assassins Creed Renaissance is described as one of the best action and adventures 
                    packed in the book. Ezio embarks upon an epic quest for vengeance during the Renaissance in this novel based on the Assassin's Creed video game 
                    series. 
                <br>
                To eradicate corruption and restore his family’s honor, Ezio will learn the art of the Assassins. Along the way, he will call upon the wisdom of such 
                great minds as Leonardo da Vinci and Niccolo Machiavello—knowing that survival is bound to the skills by which he must live.
                <br>
                In this book the charater Desmond Miles who carries the assassins genetics is set on a mission to explore himself and with the help of the abstergo deivce 
                he went back in time where his forefathers like Ezio and lead his life to know about templars and eradicate them.

               aged seventeen and ends the novel aged forty. That is a very long life span for a character who still has three novels to be involved in. Ezio begins as 
               the typical teenage character – he is a player, he is fun loving, and he enjoys picking a fight with the obviously evil son of a rival merchant family. 
               After the betrayal of a family friend which leads to the deaths of his father, older and younger brothers Ezio must escape from Florence with his

                   reluctantly before setting out to get revenge on the men who betrayed his family – and because of all the bloodshed and the truths that he slowly begins to unfold, Ezio matures into a stronger, less whiney character who actually has the capability of amazing development.

                It will be interesting for the readers, what was basically through Desmond’s eyes what was happening during his time in the animus as he witnessed the 
                turmoil that his ancestor had to go through; the entire story focusing solely on Ezio without breaking out into the modern era and sudden glimpses of 
                Desmond will make the readers time travel from  the modern period to  the ancient renaissance period of the human life meeting some real characters like 
                Leonardo Da Vinci. "I WILL SEEK VENGEANCE UPON THOSE WHO BETRAYED MY FAMILY. I AM EZIO AUDITORE DA FIRENZE. I AM AN ASSASSIN." by Ezio Auditor Da Firenze.

<img id="myImg" src="images/dune1.jpg" alt="Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert,Dune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal 
interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet 
Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or spice, a drug that extends life and enhances 
mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As 
melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, 
religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice  Duke Leto’s 
son, Paul, is in bed when his mother, Jessica, and Reverend Mother Mohiam check in on him. The old reverend mother mutters that Paul may be the Kwisatz Haderach, the one 
who brings about important changes in the universe. Reverend Mother Mohiam says that the next day, Paul will meet her gom jabbar, an instrument that poisons and kills 
instantly, unless he passes her test. To test whether Paul is human, the Reverend Mother Mohiam has him put his hand into a small box. The box brings great pain to Paul, 
but he knows that if he moves, the Reverend Mother Mohiam will stab him with the gom jabbar. He passes Mohiam’s test, which means he is a human being and not an animal. 
He then discovers that Jessica took the same test long ago; the reverend mother was her teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. The two women reveal to Paul that something 
terrible will soon happen to the House of Atreides and that his father will die. The two women tell Paul that the duke’s death will happen soon after the Atreides move 
to Arrakis, the desert planet, now ruled by the Atreides’s mortal enemies, the Harkonnens. On another planet, the fat Baron Harkonnen reveals his plot to his nephew 
Feyd-Rautha and his servant, Piter, a Mentat, a person who thinks using logic and no emotions. The baron has maneuvered the emperor, the leader of the universe, into 
giving the planet Arrakis to the Atreides in exchange for the planet Caladan. Though Arrakis is a desert planet and Caladan a lush one, this trade does not seem good for 
the baron; Arrakis is rich in melange, a drug and spice that is an addiction for millions of people throughout the galaxy. The baron has arranged this trade because he 
plans to kill Duke Leto and all his family once they are on Arrakis by using one of their own people to betray them. On another planet, the fat Baron Harkonnen reveals 
his plot to his nephew Feyd-Rautha and his servant, Piter, a Mentat, a person who thinks using logic and no emotions. The baron has maneuvered the emperor, the leader of

trade because he plans to kill Duke Leto and all his family once they are on Arrakis by using one of their own people to betray them. Piter trades barbs with his fat 
master as Feyd-Rautha looks on passively. Later, Paul meets Thufir Hawat, the duke’s main strategist, in the training room. Hawat warns Paul of the dangers he will face 
on Arrakis, but he tries to dispel Paul’s fears that his father will be killed. He also mentions the Fremen, the native inhabitants of Arrakis. Hawat explains that the 
Fremen are a tough, resilient people, and they will have to be dealt with in some way by the Atreides. After Hawat leaves, Gurney Halleck, the duke’s war master, appears 
and challenges Paul to a training duel. Paul fights well, but Halleck makes the battle difficult for him, since he knows that Paul may actually have to fight someone 
soon. Finally, Paul meets with Dr. Yueh, a doctor of the Atreides, who gives him some information about the life-forms on Arrakis—including the planet’s sandworms." />

two meet, Seldon uses a branch of mathematics called psychohistory to prove that the Galactic Empire will fall in three centuries, ushering in a galaxy-wide Dark Age. 
But, fear not, Seldon has a plan that he and Gaal will discuss at length tomorrow at the university. When he's arrested and exiled, Seldon reveals his plan: he'll use his 
exile to build Foundations that will reduce the Dark Age from 30,000 years to 1,000 years. Fifty years later, the mayor of the first Foundation, Salvor Hardin, has a 
couple of problems. His planet is a wasteland; the neighboring planets are after him; and the Board of Trustees are more focused on completing Hari Seldon's Encyclopedia 
Galactic than actually running the planet. Hardin's plan? A coup d'état. But then a message from Hari Seldon appears, and Hardin realizes that the encyclopedia was a 
trick—and Hardon has to take over the Foundation and fulfill Seldon's real plan. Thirty years after the coup d'état, Hardin remains the mayor of the new City Council. 
But mo' power mo' problems. A new political group called the Action party has risen to power and is trying to impeach him, plus more neighboring planets have their sights 
on his lands. Outnumber and outgunned, he must out-think his way through this Seldon Crisis. He does this by convincing his enemies that the Foundation's religious group 
doesn't support the war—and then hears another prerecorded message from Seldon that warns that the future holds many more challenges. Limmar Ponyets is sent to rescue 
Eskel Gorov from the planet Askone. He then has the bright idea to trade gold instead of technology and whips up a gold transmuting machine (naturally). A councilman 
named Pherl takes notice of Ponyets's nifty trick and agrees to let Ponyets and Gorov go, and give them some iron, in exchange for the machine. Surprise! Ponyets has 
recorded the convo and blackmails Pherl into letting them walk away with a lot more. Foundation guy Hober Mallow heads to the planet Korell to investigate some missing 
ships. There, after a little kerfuffle over a religious missionary, he establishes trade with the planet. After a quick detour to planet Siwenna, where he finds out that

mayor. Success! Two years later, Korell attacks the Foundation. Turns out, Mallow has anticipated this: he's made Korell so dependent on the Foundation that Korell's 
economy collapses and the Foundation wins the war without even trying.Foundation guy Hober Mallow heads to the planet Korell to investigate some missing ships. There,

<img id="myImg2" src="images/martian(new).jpg" alt="In the year 2035, the crew of NASA's Ares 3 mission have arrived at Acidalia Planitia for a planned month-long stay on 
Mars. After only six sols, an intense dust and wind storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), which would trap them on the planet. During the hurried 
evacuation, an antenna tears loose and impales astronaut Mark Watney, a botanist and engineer, also disabling his spacesuit radio. He is flung out of sight by the wind 
and presumed dead. As the MAV teeters dangerously, mission commander Melissa Lewis has no choice but to take off without completing the search for Watney. However, Watney 
is not dead. His injury proves relatively minor, but with no long-range radio, he cannot communicate with anyone. He must rely on his own resourcefulness to survive. He 
begins a log of his experiences. His philosophy is to work the problem, solving each challenge in turn as it confronts him. With food a critical, though not immediate, 
problem, he begins growing potatoes in the crew's Martian habitat (the Hab), and burns hydrazine to generate water for the plants. NASA eventually discovers that Watney 
is alive when satellite images of the landing site show evidence of his activities; NASA personnel begin devising ways to rescue him, but withhold the news of his 
survival from the rest of the Ares 3 crew, on their way back to Earth aboard the Hermes spacecraft, so as not to distract them. Watney plans to drive 3,235 km (2,010 mi) 
to Schiaparelli crater where the next mission, Ares 4, will land in four years and whose MAV is already pre-positioned. He begins modifying one of the rovers for the 
journey, adding solar cells and an additional battery. He makes a three-week test drive to recover the Pathfinder lander and Sojourner rover and brings them back to the 
Hab, enabling him to contact NASA. Mitch Henderson, the Ares 3 flight director, convinces NASA Administrator Teddy Sanders to allow him to inform the Ares 3 crew of 
Watney's survival; they are thrilled, except for Lewis, who is guilt-stricken at leaving him behind. The canvas at one of the Hab airlocks tears because of Watney's 
repeated use of the same airlock, which was not designed for frequent and long-term usage. This results in the decompression of the Hab and nearly kills him. He repairs 
the Hab, but his plants are dead, threatening him again with eventual starvation. Setting aside safety protocols to comply with time constraints, NASA hastily prepares 
an uncrewed probe to send Watney supplies, but the rocket disintegrates after liftoff. A deal with the China National Space Administration provides a ready 
booster—planned for use with the Taiyang Shen, an uncrewed solar probe—to try again. With no time to build a probe with a soft-landing system, NASA is faced with the 
prospect of building a capsule whose cargo can survive crashing into the Martian surface at 300 meters per second (670 mph). However, astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises 
a slingshot trajectory around Earth for a gravity assist that could get Hermes back to Mars on a much-extended mission to save Watney, using the Chinese rocket booster to 
send a simpler resupply probe to Hermes as it passes Earth. Sanders vetoes the Rich Purnell Maneuver, as it would entail risking the other crewmembers, but Henderson 
secretly emails the details to Hermes. All five of Watney's crewmates approve the plan. Once they begin the maneuver (having disabled the remote overrides), NASA has no 
choice but to support them. The resupply ship docks with Hermes successfully. After Watney leaves for Schiaparelli, NASA discovers that a dust storm is approaching his 
path, but has no way to warn him. The rover's solar cells will be less and less able to recharge, endangering both the rendezvous and his immediate survival (if there is 
not enough power to run his life-support equipment). While crossing Arabia Terra, Watney becomes aware of the darkening sky and improvises a rough measurement of the 
storm's shape and direction of movement, enabling him to go around it.Surviving a rover rollover on his descent into Schiaparelli, Watney reaches the MAV and 
reestablishes contact with NASA. He receives instructions on the radical modifications necessary to reduce the MAV's weight to enable it to intercept Hermes during its 
flyby. The modifications include removing the front of the MAV, which Watney has to cover with Hab canvas. After takeoff, the canvas tears, creating extra drag and l
eaving the MAV too low for the rendezvous. Lewis hastily improvises a plan to intercept the MAV by firing Hermes' attitude thrusters and then blowing a hole in the front 
airlock with an improvised sugar-and-liquid-oxygen bomb, using the thrust from the escaping air to reduce speed. Beck, the Hermes' EVA specialist, uses a Manned 
Maneuvering Unit, MMU, on a tether to reach Watney and bring him back to Hermes. In a final log entry, Watney expresses his joy at being rescued, reflecting on the human 
instinct to help those in need." />

odds with most of the scientific community, including Drumlin, who tries to have the funding to SETI cut off. To his surprise, the project discovers a signal containing a 
series of prime numbers coming from the Vega system 26 light years away. Further analysis reveals information in the polarization modulation of the signal: a 
retransmission of Adolf Hitler's opening speech at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, the first television signal powerful enough to escape Earth's ionosphere. The

with a newly formed consortium. The participants reach a consensus that the machine is a dodecahedron-shaped vehicle with five seats. At the conference, Ellie meets Devi 
Sukhavati, a doctor who left India to marry the man she loved, only to lose him to illness a year later. The final piece of the message is discovered when S. R. Hadden, 
a billionaire in multiple high-tech industries with an obsessive personal interest in the concept of immortality, suggests that Ellie check for phase modulation. This 
reveals the primer, thus allowing construction of the machine to begin.The American and Soviet governments enter a race to construct identical copies of the machine. As 
errors in the Soviet project are discovered, the American machine becomes the only option. Ellie applies to be one of the five passengers, but her spot is given to David 
Drumlin instead. Despite heavy security, a group of extremists is able to get a bomb into one of the fabrication plants in Wyoming. During a visit by three astronomers, 
the bomb explodes, killing Drumlin and postponing completion of the machine indefinitely. Ellie's family also suffers when her mother has a stroke, which causes 
paralysis. John Staughton accuses Ellie of ignoring her own mother for years. Ellie learns that S. R. Hadden has taken up residence aboard a private space station. While 
on board, he reveals that his company has been covertly building a third copy of the machine in Hokkaido, Japan. The activation date is set for December 31, 1999 and 
Ellie, Vaygay and Devi are given three of the seats. The other two are given to Abonnema Eda, a Nigerian physicist credited with discovering the theory of everything and 
Xi Qiaomu, a Chinese archaeologist and expert on the Qin dynasty. While in Japan, Ellie receives a medallion from Joss, which she carries aboard the Machine as it is 
activated. Once activated, the dodecahedron transports the group through a series of wormholes to a massive station near the center of the Milky Way. The station contains 
a surreal Earth-like beach where the five are split up. Ellie meets an extraterrestrial in a form indistinguishable from Ted Arroway, who explains his people's reasons 
for making contact, and tells her of their ongoing project to alter the properties of the universe by accumulating enough mass in Cygnus A to counter the effects of 
entropy. He also tells her that the wormhole system was built by unknown precursors, and hints at the discovery of artificial messages in transcendental numbers like π. 
Ellie is reunited with the other four travellers who have also met simulations of their loved ones. She captures video evidence of the encounter before the dodecahedron 
takes them back to Earth.Upon returning, the passengers discover that what seemed like many hours took no time at all from Earth's perspective. They also find that all of 
their video footage has been erased, presumably by magnetic fields in the wormholes. After seeing that Hadden is apparently dead and that the transmission has somehow 
been stopped without a 26[3]-year delay, government officials accuse the travellers of an international conspiracy. They blackmail Ellie and her fellow travellers into 
silence until more evidence can be found. Palmer Joss becomes one of the few people willing to believe her story that she can only justify on faith. Acting on the 
suggestion of Ted, Ellie works on a program to compute the digits of π to heretofore-unprecedented lengths. Ellie's mother dies before this project delivers its first 
result. A final letter from her informs Ellie that John Staughton, not Ted Arroway, is Ellie's biological father. When Ellie looks at what the computer has found, she 
sees a circle rasterized from 0s and 1s that appear after 1020 places in the base 11 representation of π. This not only provides evidence of her journey, but suggests 
that intelligence is behind the universe itself." />

<img id="myImg4" src="images/dispos1.jpg" alt="A group of protestors gathers at the wall that surrounds the Port of Anarres as a spaceship docked there prepares for 
liftoff. As a man crosses the wall and walks through the barren field toward the ship, the protestors recognize him and begin to chase him. Members of the Anarresti 
Defense syndicate flank the man and hurry him to the ship as protestors begin throwing rocks, clipping the man’s shoulder and killing a Defense syndic. The passenger 
makes it on board and the ship doors close, and within a few minutes the angry mob disperses. Onboard the ship—a freighter called the Mindful—the passenger, a man named 
Shevek, is taken to his cabin and injected with several vaccines by a Urrasti doctor named Kimoe. In the days that follow, Shevek runs a high fever as a side effect of 
the various vaccines, and when he awakes, he finds that he is halfway to Urras—the Moon, twin, and rival planet of his home planet, Anarres. Through conversations with 
Dr. Kimoe, Shevek prepares himself for landing on the capitalist, deeply socially-stratified world of Urras. The Mindful lands and Shevek disembarks. He is met by 
reporters and paparazzi who photograph him and shout at him—he is “The First Man From the Moon” to them. A limousine arrives to take Shevek to the capital city of Nio 
Esseia, where he will be staying at the Ieu Eun University. His handlers—a group of five men—point out the sights to Shevek as the countryside flies by. At the 
University, Shevek meets with University officials and diplomats of the state of A-Io alike, and the Ioti President makes a toast to “a new era of brotherhood” between 
the Twin Planets. After the party, Shevek’s escorts bring him to his room at the university and help him to settle in. In a flashback, the narrative transitions to the 
Anarres of Shevek’s youth. The novel transitions back and forth in alternating chapters between the “present”—Shevek’s journey to Urras—and the story of his past on 
Anarres. As an infant, Shevek plays with other children in an Anarresti communal nursery, unable to grasp that nothing—no toys, no objects—belong to him. Everything on 
Anarres belongs to everyone. Shevek’s father Palat has come to collect Shevek from the nursery in order to say goodbye to his mother, Rulag, who has been posted to a work 
assignment far away—Anarresti society functions in groups of Syndicates, and labor rotation often splits up family units or forces people to make large moves at a 
moment’s notice. The narrative flashes forward a few years to Shevek’s school days. As an eight-year-old, he is uncannily bright and still decisively impetuous, and his 
teacher at the learning center accuses Shevek of “egoizing” as he attempts to explain a complicated math problem to his fellow students. Shevek is sent out of class and 
realizes he will have to wait for the day when others are interested in the same kind of problems as him. The narrative flashes forward again—a preteen Shevek and his 
friends are learning about the concept of prisons, which do not exist on Anarres. The boys, fascinated by the idea, decide to create a prison of their own. They lock up 
one of their friends, Kadagv, and leave him in a crawl space beneath the school for thirty hours. When they release him, he has soiled himself, and Shevek understands for 
the first time the violence of power over others. The narrative flashes forward yet again. Shevek is a student at the Northsetting Regional Institute—he is a teenager, 
and he and his childhood friends Tirin and Bedap carry on a speculative conversation about Urras. The boys recently saw some old footage of life on Urras during one of 
their classes, and were overwhelmed by the enormous gap between the destitute poor in the Urrasti nation of Thu, and the wealthy “propertied class” based in the 
prosperous nation of A-Io. The Odonian Revolution, which brought Urrasti anarchists to Anarres over one hundred and fifty years ago, has created a barrier between the 
planets which cannot be breached—except, the boys know, for trading of resources between the two several times a year via freighters, which are not allowed beyond the 
Port of Anarres. In yet another flash forward, the eighteen-year-old Shevek is off on his first work posting, doing manual labor in the dusty desert. Shevek embarks on a 
romantic relationship with a woman named Beshun, but it goes south when the two of them receive new work postings. Shevek returns to the familiarity of the Northsetting 
Regional Institute, and the tutelage of his physics teacher, the wise and old Mitis. Mitis forwards one of Shevek’s advanced papers to a physicist named Sabul in the big 
city of Abbenay, and Shevek receives an invitation to go and study with the man. Mitis warns Shevek that he will become Sabul’s property if he goes, but because no one 
owns anyone or anything else on Anarres, Shevek does not pay close attention to her advice.On Urras, Shevek awakes in his room at Ieu Eun University. He is amazed by the size and luxury of his room there, and cannot believe he has it all to himself. Shevek looks out the window at the beautiful Urrasti landscape, and thinks that it is “what a world is supposed to look like.” Shevek meets his manservant Efor, though he doesn’t understand what it is to be served, and then welcomes to his rooms a group of Urrasti physicists who are meant to be his guides. Chifoilisk, Oiie, Atro, and Pae rejoice at meeting Shevek, who they have been communicating with through letters and radio broadcasts for many years. The men welcome Shevek “home” and present him with a solid-gold statue—an award he won in absentia many years ago. The men ask Shevek how far along he is in his General Temporal Theory—the theory he has come to Urras to complete—and Shevek assures him that the whole thing is in his head. Shevek is delighted to find that he has encountered his intellectual and conversational equals at last, and explains to the men that he has come to their world not as an Anarresti ambassador but as a physicist following his own personal initiative. Shevek, confined to his room for several days while his vaccinations take hold, spends his time reading the books his handlers bring him—Urrasti science, history, and art, as well as newspapers which describe a growing unrest in the Urrasti state of Benbili. After three days, Shevek is allowed out, and his handlers take him all through the city and the country. At the end of his days of tourism, Shevek realizes he has been foolish in thinking he could bring the two vastly different worlds together—he feels he belongs to neither of them.
In the past narrative, Shevek arrives in Abbenay and makes his way to the Central Institute of the Sciences, where he is given a single room for the first time in his 
life. The following day he meets with Sabul, the physicist who will be his mentor. Sabul, a gruff and unpleasant man, tells Shevek that he must learn Ioti—the language of 
Urras—before he can be taught any real physics, as the latest developments in physics all happen on Urras and are written in Iotic. Sabul warns Shevek not to share his 
Ioti texts with anyone, or to tell anyone he is learning the language. Shevek quickly learns Ioti after isolating himself in his rooms and studying hard. He only leaves 
to attend lectures in physics delivered by Gvarab—an elderly but brilliant woman who is not well-respected at the Institute by anyone other than Shevek. Shevek begins 
early work on a unified theory of time, and meanwhile writes criticism of Urrasti work which Sabul sends, via freighter, directly to the physicists back on Urras. Shevek 
is excited but nervous to communicate with the Urrasti—a major taboo on Anarres. Shevek eventually discovers that Sabul has been taking credit for his work while 
corresponding with the Urrasti, since in theory everything belongs to everyone on Anarres. Shevek falls ill with a fever and checks himself into a nearby clinic. When his 
fever breaks, he wakes to find a woman sitting by his side—she reveals she is his mother, Rulag. She asks about Shevek’s father, and Shevek reveals that Palat died many 
years ago. Rulag tells Shevek that her work always came first—she doesn’t quite apologize, but Shevek can see the pain and loneliness on her face. Rulag asks Shevek if 
the two of them can have a relationship at last, but Shevek refuses her, and Rulag leaves him alone and weeping in the clinic. On Urras, Shevek settles down and gets to 
work as a new term begins at Ieu Eun University. He takes on some teaching duties and publishes some papers, but because he is not working on his General Temporal Theory 
he feels he is accomplishing nothing of value. Shevek goes shopping for the first time in his life and purchases an expensive suit and shoes, which are tailor-made for 
him. In a meeting with Chifoilisk, a physicist from the socialist state of Thu, Chifoilisk warns Shevek not to let himself be “bought” by the Ioti, and warns him 
especially not to write down his General Temporal Theory even if he finishes it—the Ioti government will surely take it from him and seize it as their own property. Less 
than a week after their conversation, Pae informs Shevek that Chifoilisk has been called—or sent—back to his home country of Thu. In Chifoilisk’s absence Shevek develops 
a friendship with the renowned physicist Atro, who believes that Cetians—the race of the Urrasti and Anarresti people—are superior in the galaxy and the only form of 
humanity meant to prosper. Atro tells Shevek that when it comes time for him to release his General Temporal Theory, he should make sure that it is Cetians and Cetians 
alone who benefit from it. In the past, after recovering from his illness, Shevek returns to his room at the Institute. He no longer isolates himself with his work, 
hearing his mother Rulag’s words in his ear and fearing to become a slave to his own egoism. Shevek begins writing his own letters to the physicists on Urras, but Sabul 
will not send them for him, vindictively refusing to transport any material that doesn’t deal directly with his own research. Shevek excitedly looks forward to the very 
few letters he receives from Urras each year. Gvarab dies, and Shevek is overwhelmed by feelings of futility. He reunites with his childhood friend, Bedap, and the two 
briefly pursue a romantic relationship. They argue frequently, though, and soon part ways. They remain close friends who discuss clandestinely the ways in which 
Anarresti customs are barriers to progress, change, free will, and the advancement of society and intellect. Bedap invites Shevek on a hiking trip with a group of 
friends, and on the trek Shevek meets Takver, a woman to whom he is instantly attracted. Bedap points out that Takver attended school with them at Northsetting, and 
Shevek is embarrassed to not have remembered her. After a few days of hiking, Shevek and Takver, alone for the first time, fall into a conversation about their mutual 
attraction and their shared desire for exclusive partnership—something of a rarity on Anarres. After the trip, the two of them move in together, and embark on a romantic 
relationship." />

<img id="myImg5" src="images/wrinkle3(new).jpg" alt="A Wrinkle in Time is the story of Meg Murry, a high-school-aged girl who is transported on an adventure through time 
and space with her younger brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calvin O'Keefe to rescue her father, a gifted scientist, from the evil forces that hold him prisoner on 
another planet. At the beginning of the book, Meg is a homely, awkward, but loving girl, troubled by personal insecurities and her concern for her father, who has been 
missing for over a year. The plot begins with the arrival of Mrs. Whatsit at the Murry house on a dark and stormy evening. Although she looks like an eccentric tramp, she 
is actually a celestial creature with the ability to read Meg's thoughts. She startles Meg's mother by reassuring her of the existence of a tesseract--a sort of wrinkle 
in space and time. It is through this wrinkle that Meg and her companions will travel through the fifth dimension in search of Mr. Murry. On the afternoon following Mrs. 
Whatsit's visit, Meg and Charles Wallace walk over to Mrs. Whatsit's cabin. On the way, they meet Calvin O'Keefe, a popular boy in Meg's school whom Charles considers a 
kindred spirit. The three children learn from Mrs. Whatsit and her friends Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which that the universe is threatened by a great evil called the Dark Thing 
and taking the form of a giant cloud, engulfing the stars around it. Several planets have already succumbed to this evil force, including Camazotz, the planet on which 
Mr. Murry is imprisoned. The three Mrs. W's transport the children to Camazotz and instruct them to remain always in each other's company while on their quest for Mr. 
Murry. On Camazotz, all objects and places appear exactly alike because the whole planet must conform to the terrifying rhythmic pulsation of IT, a giant disembodied 
brain. Charles Wallace tries to fight IT with his exceptional intelligence but is overpowered by the evil and becomes a robot-like creature mouthing the words with which 
IT infuses him. Under the control of IT, Charles leads Meg and Calvin to Mr. Murry and together they confront IT. However, they, too, are unable to withstand IT's power; 
they escape only at the last minute, when Mr. Murry appears and seizes Meg and Calvin, tessering away with them (traveling via another tesseract) to a gray planet called 
Ixchel inhabited by tall, furry beasts who care for the travelers. Charles Wallace remains possessed by IT, a prisoner of Camazotz. On Planet Ixchel the three Mrs. W's 
appear once again, and Meg realizes that she must travel alone back to Camazotz to rescue her brother. Mrs. Which tells her that she has one thing that IT does not have, 
and this will be her weapon against the evil. However, Meg must discover this weapon for herself. When standing in the presence of IT, Meg realizes what this is: her 
ability to love. Thus, by concentrating on her love for Charles Wallace, she is able to restore him to his true identity. Meg releases Charles from IT's clutches and 
tessers with him through time and space, landing in her twin brothers' vegetable garden on Earth, where her father and Calvin stand waiting. The family joyously reunites, 
and the Mrs. W's visit the happy scene en route to further travels." />
