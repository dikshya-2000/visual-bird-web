                <h1>Summary- Born A Crime</h1>
                <p>In Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, comedian and television personality Trevor Noah gives a heartfelt and funny recounting of his 
                   experiences growing up in South Africa as an oppressed person. Stories of Noah’s life are interspersed with insights into the South Africa’s culture, 
                   systems, and history. Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, during the time of racial segregation known as apartheid. Patricia was a 
                   strong, driven woman who paid little heed to the racist laws that oppressed her. Noah’s father, Robert, agreed to give Patricia a child during a time 
                   when sexual relationships between black and white South Africans were illegal. Robert, a Swiss immigrant, never supported segregation and did what he 
                   could to undermine apartheid. Because it was dangerous for Patricia and Robert to be seen with their mixed-race child, Noah recalls sometimes being 
                   momentarily abandoned by his parents in public settings. 
                <br>
                Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor

                <p>to run their farms on stolen land. The white South Africans called Afrikaners are descended from these colonizers. Black South Africans, from tribes 
                   including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid law until the mid-1990s. A third racial group emerged from the 
                   intermingling of the Black and white South Africans: mixed-race or “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race South 
                   Africans were the most marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by what he wasn’t: not light enough to be labeled as white and 
                   not dark enough to be fully accepted into Black culture.
                <br>
                Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It was often hard for Noah to determine which groups would 
                accept him. Patricia had always encouraged her son to read and think independently; she valued education and made sure that her son spoke multiple 
                languages. Of the eleven official languages

                <h1>Summary- Born A Crime</h1>
                <p>in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans. This skill allowed him to move among different racial and cultural groups at 
                   school. Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability to talk and empathize with many different types of people served him well 
                   throughout his life. Even at a young age, Noah understood that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the 
                   self-hatred all mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but Patricia believed in tempering her punishments with 
                   assurances to her son that she held him accountable because she loved him. Patricia knew that the world would not always be kind and generous to Noah, 
                   and she wanted to prepare him well.
                <br>
                During his high school years, Noah acquired a small bootleg CD business from a friend. Noah soon found that he could make more money working with his 
                friend Sizwe, who was from the poorer, crowded

                Johannesburg township called Alexandra—known to most residents as Alex. After graduation Noah moved to Alex to expand his profits, with Sizwe’s help. 
                Sizwe recognized that Noah had talent as a live DJ, and the pair formed a performance group. Noah and his group sold bootleg and mixed CDs, dealt in 
                stolen goods, performed at parties and concerts, and did their best to avoid confrontations with local law enforcement. Noah was already familiar with the 
                South African police. Patricia received no help from the local police when she tried to file charges against abusive husband. Noah was arrested for 
                shoplifting, on suspicion of carrying a weapon, and for driving an unregistered vehicle. One arrest kept Noah in jail for several days, and Patricia had 
                to pay for his lawyer. Despite his dealings with law enforcement, Noah could see his own privilege in comparison to many of his peers. Patricia had worked 
                hard to make sure her son had the ability to make a life for himself.

                <p>The men in Noah’s life taught him little about how to interact with women. Robert was a distant but generally pleasant presence. Patricia’s father, 
                   Temperance Noah, was an unpredictable figure. Later, Noah would learn that his grandfather had bipolar disorder and would often beat his wife, Frances. 
                   Patricia experienced abuse in her marriage as well. Noah’s stepfather, Abel, became acquainted with Patricia and her young son during their many visits 
                   to the automotive shop where Abel worked on their run-down car. After Abel and Patricia married, he bought the shop. Patricia was forced to sell her 
                   home to keep the business running, and the family spent a stressful year living in the shop warehouse. Abel often came home drunk, and he began beating 
                   his wife. Once Abel had sons of his own, Noah’s half-brothers Andrew and Isaac, Abel’s hostility toward Patricia’s oldest son grew. When Patricia 
                   learned that her violent husband had bought a gun, she helped Noah move out on his own.

                <p>Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never 
                   supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a

<img id="myImg" src="images/blogcobook(1)new.jpg" alt="A Confederacy of Dunces presents the misadventures of Ignatius J. Reilly, a modern Don Quixote. Ignatius is a 
behemoth of fat and flatulence, with a gargantuan frame, bushy black moustache, green hunting cap, and blue and yellow eyes that look down on the modern era--and 
particularly on anything commerical. He views materialistic comforts as offenses against taste and decency, things that demonstrate a lack of theology and geometry. His 
troubles (or fateful fortunes) begin in New Orleans when an inept patrolman suspects him of being a pervert and attempts an arrest. Ignatius is able to avoid being taken 
into custody, but as people help him, a kind grandfather who stood up for him is taken to jail. Fleeing the scene, Ignatius and his mother head to Bourbon Street and stop 
off in the Night of Joy, a bar and strip club, where they receive terrible service. Mrs. Reilly throws back drink after drink, while Ignatius tells the tale of his awful 
trip to Baton Rouge (the only time he has left New Orleans). Meanwhile, at the police precinct, Claude Robichaux (the old man who helped Ignatius) has been placed on a 
bench with a young, black man wearing space-age sunglasses. This man is Burma Jones, and he has been falsely accused of stealing cashew nuts. When the police sergeant 
learns that Patrolman Mancuso has arrested a grandfather and was trying to apprehend Ignatius (a boy simply waiting for his mother), the sergeant punishes the inept 
officer: he must wear a new, ridiculous costume each day. Having been thrown out of the Night of Joy by its tyrannical proprietress, Lana Lee, Ignatius and his mother 
return to their Plymouth. A wet spot in the road (combined with the distraction caused by Ignatius's incessant complaints from the back seat) causes Mrs. Reilly to crash 
into the side of a building, bringing a balcony crashing down on the car. As a result of the car accident, Mrs. Reilly owes more than a thousand dollars for the damage. 
This debt, plus the payment that she must make each month for Ignatius's trumpet, is far more than she can afford, and she fears that she will be locked up for 
defaulting. Though Ignatius seems indifferent to the situation, Mrs. Reilly forces him to leave the comforts of his bedroom to enter the working world. gnaitus obtains a 
filing position at Levy Pants, a job that he finds surprisingly agreeable. Ignatius introduces a number of innovations to the office, such as arriving to work an hour 
late (thereby ensuring he is refreshed when he gets there) and throwing the filing in the garbage (creating more space in the filing cabinet and avoiding a fire hazard). 
He is quite fond of his coworker, Miss Trixie, a senile, old assistant accountant who wants nothing more than to retire from Levy Pants. Ignatius is so pleased with his 
new employment that he dedicates himself to raising the firm to the next level of success. According to Ignatius, the first thing the company needs to do is be more 
authoritarian with its distributors. Toward this end, he writes a letter on behalf of Mr. Levy (without his knowledge or permission) to a Levy Pants distributor, 
Abelman's Dry Goods, that has complained about a defective batch of pants. Ignatius's letter to Mr. Abelman calls him a mongoloid and threatens to lash him should he 
bother Levy Pants again. The most important aspect of the job is that it provides the means for avenging Myrna Minkoff's latest effrontery. Myrna is an ex-girlfriend 
from college with whom he corresponds regularly. In her letters, Myrna accuses him of paranoid delusions, which she attributes to the total failure of his life. Moreover, 
she often suggests that he has homosexual tendencies. In efforts to make Myrna jealous, Ignatius plans to lead a social movement of historic proportions. Specifically, he 
convinces the Levy Pants factory workers to participate in a demonstration against the Levy Pants office manager, Mr. Gonzalez, demanding higher wages. Ignatius titles 
the protest the Crusade for Moorish Dignity, and he leads the workers into the office as they sing spirituals. The demonstration quickly falls apart, however, when news 
spreads among the workers that Ignatius may have a police record, and when Ignatius orders the workers to attack Mr. Gonzalez without even giving him the opportunity to 
respond to the demand for higher wages (this tactic they find very unfair and a confirmation that Ignatius probably is a criminal). Rather than achieving a victory for 
social justice that he can slap in Myrna's face, he ends up unemployed. Mrs. Reilly insists that Ignatius enter a new job search. He soon gets employment as a hot dog 
vendor for Paradise Vendors, Incorporated, a job which his mother finds incredibly humiliating. Ignatius brings in few profits as a vendor--he spends more time eating 
than selling the products. In an attempt to bring in more revenue, Ignatius's employer, Mr. Clyde, reassigns him to the French Quarter (where there are more tourists) 
and has Ignatius dress in a pirate costume. One day on his hot dog route, Ignatius runs into Dorian Greene, a flamboyant homosexual who throws extravagant counterculture 
parties. In talking to Dorian, Ignatius develops a new plan for social activism. He believes that if homosexuals infiltrate the armed forces and highest offices of 
countries around the world, war can be replaced with orgies and world peace can be achieved. He proposes that they form a political party and start running candidates 
immediately, including a kickoff rally. Dorian agrees to host the event. Later, Ignatius runs into George, an oily-haired, pimply teen with flamenco boots. Lana Lee from 
the Night of Joy is running a high school pornography racket on the side, and George is her delivery boy, selling her product to orphans around the city. Each day at one 
o'clock, George picks up packages containing the pornography, and he delivers them to the orphans at three o'clock. He thus needs a place to store the packages for the 
two hours between pickup and delivery, so he offers Ignatius a couple of dollars per day in exchange for renting out the bun compartment in his hot dog cart as storage 
space. Ignatius agrees but then grabs one of the packages and tears it open to see what is inside. He finds a picture of a nude woman (Lana Lee) on a desk beside a globe, 
doing something suggestive with a piece of chalk. The woman's face is covered by the book she is reading, Boethius's The Consolation of Philosophy (Ignatius' favorite 
work of literature)--and he immediately commends the woman's taste and brilliance. Seeing that an address is written on the package, he decides to investigate in order to 
identify this brilliant woman. Thus Ignatius arrives at the address written on the package and is dismayed to learn that it is the Night of Joy. Outside the bar, his 
attention falls on a poster advertising a show that the Night of Joy will be presenting, starring Harlett O'Hara (who is really Darlene, an aspiring exotic dancer who 
works at the bar) and her pet cockatoo, which Darlene has trained to yank at rings attached to her dress, thus ripping off her clothing. Seeing Ignatius on the curb 
outside her establishment and fearing that his presence will somehow ruin her investment, Lana Lee sends Jones (whom she has hired as a porter at well below minimum wage 
through threats of reporting him to the police for vagrancy) to get rid of Ignatius. Hoping to locate the sexy scholar pictured in the photograph, Ignatius asks Jones 
whether the Night of Joy employs a woman who is given to reading. Jones tells him that Harlett O'Hara is the woman he is looking for. Throughout the novel, Jones has been 
complaining of the abuse he is suffering at Lana's hands, and knowing how much she disdains the fat kook in the green hunting cap, he sees this as a perfect opportunity 
for sabotage. He informs Ignatius that Harlett O'Hara's routine will be opening in a few days, and he invites him back for a ringside table at the show. A few days later, 
dressed in his Paradise Vendors pirate suit and with a speech prepared, Ignatius heads to Dorian Greene's residence for the kickoff rally for his new degenerate political 
party. When he arrives at the party, however, he finds that the attendees are more interested in debauchery than in the critical issues of the day or in devising a plan 
for infiltrating the world's armed forces. When Ignatius shuts off the party's music and attempts to address the crowd, he is met with cries of disapproval and a barrage 
of verbal insults. The music resumes, the partygoers ignore Ignatius, and he finds himself under attack by three lesbians who rent an apartment in Dorian's building. 
Ignatius is promptly removed by force. As he leaves, a man in a silk suit and homburg hat emerges from the shadows and follows him. Ignatius's bad luck continues. He goes 
to the Night of Joy for Harlett O'Hara's opening performance but learns that Miss O'Hara is merely Darlene. When he bellows in disapproval, Darlene's bird launches toward 
his head and latches onto the gold hoop earring that he is wearing. Ignatius jumps up, lashes his arms wildly at the bird, and in the process knocks over tables, smashes 
a champagne bottle, and ruins the show. Stumbling out of the bar past Jones, he steps into the path of an oncoming bus. Ignatius faints, and Jones pulls him out of the 
way at the last second. The man in the silk suit emerges and takes control of the situation. When he asks Lana Lee if he can use her phone, she propositions him and shows 
him one of her nude pictures. The man announces that he is the undercover officer Mancuso, and he arrests her for possession of pornography. Just then, the three lesbians 
from Dorian's party arrive and assault the patrolman. Ignatius awakes in the hospital and finds that his mother is quite humiliated by the top story in the day's 
newspaper. As the article and photos reveal, after the bird attack on Ignatius, Officer Mancuso had arrested Lana Lee for soliciting and for possession of and posing for 
pornography. Additionally, he arrested the three lesbians for assault. Jones had then taken Mancuso to the cabinet under the bar, where they found packages of pornography 
and a list of names, thus cracking the most active high school pornography racket in the city. As a result of the chaos at the Night of Joy, Darlene and Jones find 
themselves out of work. Darlene, however, gets an offer from a bar owner who is attracted by all the publicity she got. After returning from the hospital, Ignatius and 
Mrs. Reilly find that Mr. Levy is waiting outside their house. Mr. Abelman has threatened a libel suit for $500,000 due to the letter that Ignatius had written while 
still employed at Levy Pants. When Mr. Levy asks if he is the author of the letter, Ignatius denies any responsibility. Instead, he pins blame on Miss Trixie, who hates 
Levy Pants for the company's refusal to retire her. When Mr. Levy goes back to Miss Trixie and confronts her with Ignatius's accusation, she confesses (she remembers how 
nice Mr. Reilly had always been to her, does not think he would lie, and notes that there is plenty she cannot remember anyway). As a result, Ignatius's lie is able to 
save Mr. Levy from a libel suit, himself from prosecution for forgery, and Miss Trixie--giving her the retirement she has desired for so long. Unaware of Miss Trixie's 
confession and fearing that Ignatius has gotten himself into serious trouble with this letter to Abelman, Mrs. Reilly decides to have Ignatius committed at Charity 
Hospital. Figuring out what his mother plans for him, Ignatius decides to attempt an escape. Just then, Myrna Minkoff arrives on his doorstep. Fearing that he needed more 
help than just a letter, Myrna had driven all night to get to Ignatius. Telling her that he has finally accepted his problems and is ready to do something with his life, 
Ignatius convinces Myrna to help him flee immediately. They gather his belongings, jump into the car and drive away, just as an ambulance with the words Charity Hospital 
on the side drives up." />

<img id="myImg1" src="images/blogcobook(2)new.jpg" alt="Me Talk Pretty One Day is a collection of essays about the everyday life of the author, David Sedaris. The book’s 
first essays detail his upbringing in North Carolina. As a child, he lives with his father, mother, and sisters. The opening essay recounts the time he’s forced to see a 
speech therapist in the fifth grade. Every Thursday, Miss Samson (the therapist) takes him out of class and brings him to her office, where she tries to train him to 
banish the lisp he has when saying the letter s. Sedaris hates this, partially because he’s one of the few boys in school who needs speech therapy. This, he believes, 
aligns him with a group of children who are unpopular, and he senses that the teachers might as well refer to them as the “future homosexuals of America.” Thinking this 
way, he wonders if his teachers are also capable of identifying the future alcoholics or “depressives” in their classrooms. Defying Miss Samson, he starts avoiding all 
s-words, using elaborate synonyms. A strict woman, Miss Samson dislikes this, but nothing she does gets Sedaris to stop. At the end of the year, she opens up to him and 
speaks emotionally about her failure as a speech therapist and about her depressing life. Seeing this, Sedaris tells her that he’s sorry, and she starts laughing, 
triumphantly informing him that she tricked him into using an s. At another point in his childhood—as outlined in “Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities”—Sedaris goes with his 
family to a jazz concert. His father, Lou, is obsessed with jazz, always forcing him and his sisters to listen to his record collection. In another life, Sedaris thinks, 
his father would have made a good musician. Because he never pursued this dream, though, he decides after the jazz concert that Sedaris and his sisters should start a 
family band. None of them are interested, but Lou signs them up for lessons. Forced to learn the guitar, Sedaris finds himself sitting in a small room with an instructor 
named Mr. Mancini. Mr. Mancini is a little person, though Sedaris refers to him using the pejorative, politically incorrect term “midget.” Sedaris makes no effort to 
learn guitar, finding himself more fascinated by Mr. Mancini than by the instrument. When Mr. Mancini advises him to give his guitar a name, he decides on Oliver, but 
Mancini says it has to be a woman’s name. Eventually, he decides to show Mr. Mancini a routine he has developed on his own, which involves singing commercial jingles he’s 
heard on TV. In response, Mr. Mancini thinks Sedaris is coming on to him and asks him to leave, saying he doesn’t “swing that way.” After this, Sedaris tells his father 
that Mr. Mancini said his fingers are too small to play guitar, and he never returns for another lesson. Sedaris’s relationship with his father is a thread that runs 
throughout Me Talk Pretty One Day, as Sedaris outlines his father’s idiosyncrasies in essays like “Genetic Engineering,” in which he describes his father’s obsession with 
mathematics and technology. As an engineer at IBM, his father often speaks at length about the future of computers or about other topics that bore Sedaris. He even 
pursues these conversations with Sedaris when they’re on vacation in a beach town, where his lecture about how estimating the number of grains of sand in the world 
attracts nearby fishermen who ironically ask him to calculate the cost of land they had to give up when rich families came to the beach town and turned it into a vacation 
destination. Failing to register their facetious tone, Lou diligently sets to work trying to answer the question. Later, Sedaris goes to college and decides to be an art 
major because he wants to be as artistically talented as his older sister Gretchen. However, he shows little talent, so he transfers to another school and tries a 
different discipline within the arts. When this doesn’t prove successful, he drops out and moves into an apartment in Raleigh, where he develops a taste for meth and 
conceptual art. Falling in with a group of experimental artists, he scoffs at art that isn’t avant-garde, claiming to be anti-establishment when, in reality, he and his 
friends are mostly interested in taking drugs and making things that even they don’t understand. Surprisingly, his work is accepted by a local museum, but this 
embarrasses him because his friends resent his success, claiming he sold out. As time passes, he develops an interest in bizarre performance art. During one of his final 
shows, an audience member heckles him, poking fun at the loftiness of his absurd display. Sedaris realizes the voice belongs to his father. By the end of the show, 
everyone thinks his father is part of the performance, and they compliment him on his wit. This frustrates Sedaris, and when he later runs out of drugs because his dealer 
goes to rehab, he gives up performance art. Lou Sedaris has unique relationships with his children, always holding them to high standards and getting disappointed when 
they show no interest in the things he values. In “You Can’t Kill The Rooster,” Sedaris describes the beautiful relationship his father has with Sedaris’s youngest 
brother, who calls himself The Rooster. Lou has high hopes for The Rooster because none of his other children have fulfilled his dreams. The Rooster, however, has no 
intention of following his father’s plans, and his personality is in direct opposition to Lou’s. And yet, this doesn’t bother Lou; when The Rooster calls his father 
“bitch,” for instance, the old man simply smiles. Observing this relationship, Sedaris and his sisters are baffled that the two men get along so well, but Sedaris 
recognizes a tenderness running between them—a tenderness that transcends the fact that The Rooster doesn’t live the life Lou originally wanted for him. In terms of 
accomplishments, Sedaris interrogates his own working life in “Learning Curve,” in which he’s hired as a writing professor despite his lack of experience. At first, he 
focuses on nothing but what he’ll wear, but he soon realizes that he also needs to think about how to fill up class time, so he starts watching soap operas with the 
students under the pretense that this will help them learn to write. When an older student furiously asks why he’s qualified to critique one of her essays, he finds 
himself at a loss for words. After a moment, though, he realizes what he needs to say: “I am the only one who is paid to be in this room.” This seems to work, but then 
the student asks how much he earns, and when he answers, the students unite with each other for the first time all semester, loudly laughing in unison. Later in life, 
Sedaris moves to New York City and lives in a small apartment. He strolls through the city in the evenings and peers into the windows of townhouses, wishing he could live 
in such beautiful buildings. When he gets hired as a personal assistant to a rich woman named Valencia, he’s delighted that he can spend several days a week in her house, 
but the job soon gets old because Valencia annoys him by pretending to be poor. She haggles over prices and tries to underpay people who need the money more than she 
does. In keeping with this, Sedaris’s wage is much less than it should be, but he puts up with her because he doesn’t feel like finding a new job. When a group of movers 
comes to move some furniture from her townhouse to a friend’s apartment, though, they offer Sedaris a job, and he accepts it. Riding away with them in their truck, he 
realizes that this is where he belongs—in a crowded vehicle with kind people, not in a beautiful townhouse with meanspirited rich people. While living in New York City, 
Sedaris meets Hugh, a man who lives in a nice apartment and owns a small house in Normandy, France. This intrigues Sedaris, who starts dating him and eventually visits 
France for the first time without knowing the language. On that first visit—outlined in “See You Again Yesterday”—he only knows how to say “bottleneck,” and he says it 
whenever he meets somebody. The next time, though, he tries to acquire a few more words, and his process continues on each subsequent visit. At this point in the essay 
collection, Sedaris devotes himself to chronicling what it’s like to live in France as an American, especially when he and Hugh move to Paris for several years. During 
this time, he struggles to learn French under the tutelage of a frightening and rude teacher, walks around the city listening to a French audiobook for medical doctors 
trying to learn clinical phrases, considers the way French people view Americans, and tries unsuccessfully to remember which French words are masculine and which are 
feminine—a practice he finds frustrating and ridiculous. Sedaris pays close attention to the various assumptions and stereotypes that come along with national identity, 
especially in “Picka Pocketoni,” in which an American couple riding the metro in Paris mistakes Sedaris for a French pickpocket and says rude things about him because 
they assume he can’t speak English. This makes Sedaris hate them, though he also recognizes that part of his anger has to do with his own pretentiousness. This 
realization only makes him hate them even more. In addition to examining cultural identity, Sedaris thinks about the ways in which intelligence impacts his sense of self. 
In the essays “21 Down” and “Smart Guy,” he reveals his fear that he’s unintelligent, making it clear that he wants to be seen as a genius who can easily complete 
crossword puzzles and has a high IQ. Unfortunately for him, though, he isn’t particularly gifted at crossword puzzles, and when he and Hugh take an IQ test, he discovers 
that he’s “practically an idiot.” Hugh, on the other hand, has an incredibly high IQ, a fact that makes Sedaris feel even worse about himself. Trying to console him, Hugh 
tells him not to take his score to heart, adding that Sedaris is perfectly good at a number of things, including vacuuming and naming stuffed animals. There might be 
other things Sedaris is good at, Hugh offers, saying that he needs time to think of what, exactly, these things are. All in all, Me Talk Pretty One Day sheds light on the 
little details of everyday life, highlighting strange encounters Sedaris has had in a number of different contexts. Accordingly, there are too many small interactions 
laid out in the book to mention here. What’s important to grasp, though, is that Sedaris is interested in exposing not only the absurdities that people overlook in daily 
life, but also the humor that can be found in even the most mundane situations. To drive this point home, he ends the collection with a story about his father’s approach 
to storing food. This topic might not sound all that interesting, but Sedaris manages to emphasize the humor of his father’s strange behavior. When Lou visits him in 
Paris, he explains that he found a small brown object in his suitcase and tried to eat it. This is because Lou never wastes food and has no problem eating things that 
look spoiled. Placing the object in his mouth, he chewed it for five minutes before realizing it was a disintegrated piece of his hat. Hearing this, Sedaris knows his 
father will now store the hat with the rest of his rotting food, saving it for a time when he has nothing else to eat. And instead of criticizing Lou for this, Sedaris 
simply appreciates the humor inherent in his beloved father’s odd behavior." />

<img id="myImg2" src="images/blogcobook(3)new.jpg" alt="The popularity of the memoir format combined with a cultural insistence on elevating the banal into the sublime 
often leaves the reader unfulfilled and only mildly interested, as though they just skimmed a series of lunchtime Google chats. WYD? Tuna salad for lunch. The day is 
going by so fast. I can’t believe I’m so busy. Guess what funny thing just happened? Half of the book is composed of the most popular blog posts, such as “The God of 
Cake”—still hilarious after numerous readings—in which Brosh acts a stone-cold fool while scheming to eat her grandmother’s birthday cake, and “Dogs Don’t Understand 
Basic Concepts Like Moving,” where her anxious canines vomit, cry, and crawl their way into a new house. The other half is made up of new pieces that come off like a 
co-worker retelling jokes heard the night before at a comedy show. Maybe it was funny, but you probably had to be there to really appreciate it. “Dinosaur (the Goose 
Story)” is a prime example. In the heat of the moment, a goose walking into the house, running and chasing the inhabitants, probably makes for a bit some excitement. On 
the page, even with the adorably sad-faced shark that she uses as her alter ego, it is less so. This is despite photographs documenting the event, which she included 
because she says “While all of this was happening, I knew that it was probably going to be a story I’d write down someday. I also knew that the people reading it would 
probably feel some doubt to its veracity.” Hyperbole shares some commonalities with graphic memoirs such as Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis and Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home. 
Unlike those memoirs, where government repression (Satrapi) and sexual and gender identity (Bechdel) were the overriding themes that colored the authors’ everyday 
occurrences, Brosh’s mental illness makes up only two of the 16 chapters. The depth of those two chapters compared with the relatively frivolous narratives in the rest of 
the book makes them feel as though they came from an entirely different memoir. The depression entries (“Depression Part One,” “Depression Part Two”) are straightforward 
and poignant, but Brosh seems to undercut them later in “Identity Part One” and “Identity Part Two,” where she journeys into her subconscious—currently occupied by a 
muscular security guard named Eric—and reveals she’s “full of shit.” Is it a glib confession? A true analysis of personality? A manifestation of her depression? Or is 
just what she said it is? Should memoirists be reliable narrators? Or is the lack of reliability what makes them so compelling? Pieces in Hyperbole evince the complexity 
of our desires. We want to be seen as good people, but either we lack the motivation to actually do good things or we do it because we desire recognition. Objectively, 
it makes for an interesting meditation on what has become of social media culture: the constant trumpeting of the latest finished marathon, the newest baby, the night 
spent in VIP breathing the same air as a celebrity, the afternoon spent baking gourmet cookies or volunteering to feed the homeless. Everyone wants a like or a retweet of 
actions that are, in the grand scheme of things, pretty basic and just part of life. The documentation of all this unremarkable activity bleeds into an ambient awareness 
that people are doing things, but all of the events are broadcast with the same level of importance—that is to say, none at all. Brosh’s experiences with depression, 
which are sincerely touching and present challenges to her life with tangible physical and emotional implications, are placed alongside how she accidentally was 
introduced to hot sauce, or how she and her sibling tormented their parents with a toy parrot. The depression pieces are worth further exploration because it is the rare 
topic in the book that is “all the things”: honest, funny, a little sad, hopeful, 
imperfect, and ultimately unfinished as part of her ongoing lived narrative." />

<img id="myImg3" src="images/blogcobook(4).jpg" alt="The super short version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is, well, weird stuff happens to Arthur Dent, regular 
Earth-person. But the real joy of this book is in the weird stuff; and there's so much of it that we can't even capture it all. The longer short version starts when 
Arthur's house gets torn down so a road can be built—and his day goes downhill from there. His friend Ford Prefect is an alien. That's actually the good news of the day, 
because it's Ford who can save both of them when the alien Vogons come to destroy the Earth to make way for some sort of space road. Ford and Arthur hitch a ride with the 
Vogon ship's cooks. Unfortunately, the Vogons don't like hitchhikers, so Arthur and Ford get thrown out of the spaceship to die in the cold void of interstellar space, 
where not even Starbucks exists. Meanwhile, Ford's semi-cousin Zaphod Beeblebrox and his human companion Trillian steal the Heart of Gold spaceship, which has an amazing 
engine that can do all sorts of improbable things, such as get through LA without dealing with traffic. Also on the spaceship is a very depressed robot named Marvin. When 
Zaphod and Marvin use the Improbability Drive, they end up picking up Ford and Arthur on their way to the mythical planet of Magrathea. Magrathea was a planet that made 
other planets for rich people (the cosmic 1%), but it disappeared a while ago. Zaphod isn't even totally sure why he wants to find it, but that's because his brain 
doesn't work properly. When he does find the planet, it seems dead—but it isn't. Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian go exploring inside the planet, while Arthur and Marvin are 
left on the surface. It's then that this dude from Magrathea named Slartibartfast finds Arthur and tells him the truth about Earth. So, get this: Earth was actually a 
giant computer created to find the question that would give meaning to life. The people who ordered Earth already have the answer to the meaning of life, and that answer 
is: 42. The only trouble is that they're not sure what the question is that 42 answers. But they're pretty sure they can get it by chopping up Arthur's brain, since he 
was a part of the Earth-computer, and he was there at the end. Arthur and his friends escape—even though the cops are after them after Zaphod stole the Heart of Gold—and
decide to go get a bite to eat." />

<img id="myImg4" src="images/blogcobook(5).jpg" alt="Jim Dixon, a junior lecturer in history at a provincial English university in the years after World War II, nears the 
end of his first year at the school. Dixon has not made a good impression upon the faculty and knows that his superior, the absent-minded Professor Welch, could ask him 
to leave at the end of term next month. Fearful of making further bad impressions or revealing his inner disgust for Welch, Dixon agrees to give the end-of-term lecture 
on the theme of Merrie England and to stay with the Welches the following weekend for a weekend of music and the arts. At the party, Dixon meets Welch's son Bertrand and 
his girlfriend Christine, who have come up to the country from London. Bertrand, an artist, seems pretentious, while Christine seems uptight and unattainable. Dixon 
escapes to the pub and returns to the Welches' later that night, where he makes a drunken pass at Margaret Peel, a friend and colleague. Margaret has been staying with 
the Welches as she recovers from a recent suicide attempt caused by a recent break-up. Dixon and Margaret's friendship has rapidly been moving toward something more 
intimate, thanks to Margaret's subtle pressure and Dixon's pity and good-natured concern for Margaret. Margaret kicks Dixon out of her room, and he falls asleep while 
smoking a cigarette. Dixon wakes up in the morning to find he has burned holes in his bedsheets. Afraid of further damaging his chances of keeping his job, Dixon attempts 
to hide the damage. Christine unexpectedly find Dixon's dilemma funny and agrees to help him. Dixon thinks about Christine but does not see her again until the college's 
Summer Ball a couple of weeks later. Margaret and Bertrand both spend the night hanging around Christine's rich uncle Gore-Urquhart, who Bertrand hopes to work for. 
Dixon's friend Carol Goldsmith finally convinces Dixon to make a move for Christine by revealing that she has been having an affair with Bertrand. Dixon rallies his 
courage and asks Christine, whom Bertrand has been ignoring, to let him take her home early. Christine agrees and explains to Dixon in the taxi how Bertrand has been 
mistreating her. Back at the Welches', Christine and Dixon kiss and agree to see each other in two days. When they meet again, however, they decide not to see anymore of 
each other because of their respective obligations to both Bertrand and Margaret. Dixon spends the following week planning to write his Merrie England lecture in a 
nostalgic way that will appeal to Professor Welch, but Welch himself keeps Dixon preoccupied with menial fact-checking for Welch's own work. On the day of Dixon's 
lecture, Bertrand comes to Dixon's room and accuses Dixon of seeing Christine behind his back. Bertrand tells Dixon that Dixon is wasting his time and Dixon, fed up with 
Bertrand's hypocrisy and condescending bossiness, gets in a fight with Bertrand. Bertrand gives Dixon a black eye and Dixon knocks him down. Shaken up and nervous, Dixon 
drinks quite a lot at the reception before his lecture. He is drunk when he gives the lecture, and inadvertently imitates the voices of Professor Welch and the college 
Principal in the opening segments. Dixon rounds out the lecture by expressing his contempt for the subject before he passes out. The next day, Dixon finds he has been 
fired, but is offered a well-paying job in London by Gore-Urquhart. The same day, Dixon meets with Catchpole, the man who supposedly inspired Margaret's suicide attempt. 
Catchpole reveals that Margaret faked the suicide attempt in order to gain sympathy from Dixon and Catchpole. Dixon arrives home from this meeting to receive a message 
from Christine, asking him to meet her at the train station before her she returns to London. Dixon arrives at the station late, but so does Christine. Christine tells 
Dixon that she knows of Bertrand's affair with Carol and has broken off their relationship. Dixon tells Christine that he is through with Margaret. Dixon reveals the news 
about the job offer from Christine's uncle, Gore-Urquhart, and asks to return to London with Christine. As they walk down the street, they run into the Welch family, 
whom Dixon salutes with an explosive laugh of contempt." />

<img id="myImg5" src="images/blogcobook(6)new.jpg" alt="Where’d You Go, Bernadette, published in 2012, is the second novel by Maria Semple, a former television writer who 
worked on shows such as Mad About You and Arrested Development. A bestseller praised by numerous critics as one of the best books of the year, Where’d You Go, Bernadette 
is a fast-paced comic novel with a complex narrative structure. The book follows an epistolary format, meaning the text is largely composed of letters, emails, and other 
found documents. The events of the novel are recounted from multiple points of view by a large cast of characters, employing a wide range of voices and formats. The novel 
is set in contemporary Seattle and incorporates real places and personalities both in Seattle and beyond. The novel tells the story of Bernadette Fox, a former architect 
living in Seattle with her husband, Elgin Branch, an engineer at Microsoft and presenter of a famed TED Talk on artificial intelligence, and their teenaged daughter, Bee. 
Bernadette, though close to Bee, has become increasingly withdrawn from everyone else, employing a “virtual assistant,” supposedly based in Delhi and named Manjula, to 
manage her daily life. The family lives in a former school for wayward girls, which Bernadette intended to renovate into a functional family home but which she has 
instead allowed to fall into ruin. Elgin, immersed in his work at Microsoft, is rarely home. Bernadette and Elgin moved to Seattle from Los Angeles 20 years earlier, 
after the unexpected demolition of Bernadette’s most personal project, a residence called the Twenty Mile House, shortly after its completion. Embittered by this turn of 
events, Bernadette walked away from her career as an architect, even though she had won a MacArthur “genius grant” for her work. In Seattle, Bernadette experienced a 
series of miscarriages before giving birth to Bee, who was born with a heart defect and not expected to survive. Bee’s full name, Balakrishna, refers to the blue coloring 
she had as an infant, a consequence of her heart condition. Bee attends a small, progressive private school known as the Galer Street School, though for high school she 
plans to attend Choate, the prestigious east coast prep school once attended by her mother. As a reward for earning perfect grades during her years at Galer Street, Bee 
has chosen a family trip to Antarctica, unaware of how terrifying this prospect is to her mother. Galer Street School’s lease on its current premises is set to end, and 
the school has launched a fundraising drive and a push to attract new, wealthier parents to the school. The central event of this drive is a “Prospective Parent Brunch 
(PPB),” to be held at the home of Audrey Griffin, a Galer Street parent who lives below the Branches on a steep hillside in the Queen Anne district of Seattle. Audrey, a 
devout Christian and a leader among the Galer Street parents, has long resented the Branches’ failure to engage with the school community, not to mention their unkempt 
property. Bernadette, unaware of the Prospective Parent Brunch, is angered and surprised when Audrey Griffin demands that the blackberry brambles growing on the Branches’ 
hillside be removed. Unfortunately, the removal of the blackberries and an epic rainstorm combine to destabilize the hillside and send a mudslide crashing into the 
Griffins’ house during the brunch. Traumatized by her subsequent confrontation with an infuriated Audrey, Bernadette tells Manjula that there is no way she can travel to 
Antarctica and plans “emergency” dental surgery as a way out. Elgin, meanwhile, confused by an incident in which Bernadette tries to acquire a seasickness remedy 
containing a powerful antipsychotic, has become alarmed over his wife’s mental health and looks into having her committed to a private hospital. Elgin’s fears that 
Bernadette is out of control only grow worse when he finally learns of the mudslide. Elgin is supported in his attempts to have Bernadette committed by his personal 
assistant, or “admin,” at Microsoft, Soo-Lin Lee-Segal. Soo-Lin, also a Galer Street parent, is initially a close friend of Audrey’s, but her loyalties shift as she 
begins to fall in love with Elgin. Elgin’s sense of crisis deepens further when an FBI agent informs him that Manjula, the virtual assistant with whom Bernadette has 
shared all the family’s information, is the creation of a Russian computer crime syndicate engaged in identity theft. Elgin stages an intervention intended to force 
Bernadette into treatment, but which ends with Bernadette disappearing from the house after shutting herself in the bathroom. Elgin is left racked with guilt, especially 
after he realizes that Bernadette had changed her mind and intended to travel to Antarctica. Eventually, a charge on one of Bernadette’s cards reveals that she has 
travelled to the Antarctic and embarked on the planned cruise alone. Elgin flies to South America to meet the returning vessel, but Bernadette has disappeared yet again. 
She is presumed dead, having apparently jumped or fallen from the ship after drinking heavily throughout much of the voyage. Elgin is accompanied on this fruitless trip 
by Soo-Lin, who is now pregnant with his child. Bee has transferred to Choate midyear at her father’s urging, to escape the turmoil engulfing her family. She receives a 
mysterious manila envelope containing all the documents included in the earlier part of the book, allowing her to reconstruct the events leading up to her mother’s 
disappearance. The documents were collected by Audrey Griffin, who has experienced a change of heart after finally realizing the extent of the problems plaguing her own 
son, Kyle, and deciding to place him in rehab. When Audrey learns of the plan to commit Bernadette, she blames herself for the mudslide and various conflicts surrounding 
it. She collects the documents to demonstrate her own role in events and to prove that Bernadette is not crazy. She intends to stop the intervention, but instead ends up 
helping Bernadette escape. Bernadette asks Audrey to ensure that Bee gets the documents. Bee, who is convinced her mother is still alive somewhere in Antarctica, feels 
betrayed when she learns from the documents of her father’s plan to commit her mother and of his infidelity with Soo-Lin. Hoping to reconcile with his daughter, Elgin 
agrees to take Bee to Antarctica, unaware that she sees the trip largely as a chance to search for her mother. He also quits his job at Microsoft. On the voyage to 
Antarctica, Bee finally comes to accept that her mother may be dead. However, once there, Bee and Elgin realize that Bernadette may have found a way to stage yet another 
escape. At last, Bee finds Bernadette living at Palmer Station, a scientific research station. Bernadette heard about a construction project at the South Pole, involving
the demolition and rebuilding of an existing structure, and decided to find a way to claim the project for her own. Having recovered her passion for architecture, she 
has been working in Antarctica, unaware that Bee never received the letter explaining her decision, and unaware of the changes that have overtaken her family." />
